### Preparation

1. Go to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
2. Follow the instruction and get mongodb for your OS.
3. Use `mongo` to make sure your mongo can be accessed via port 21017.

### Build server
```
npm i
npm start
```

* If just want to play around with this repository, use `node app.js` instead of `npm start`.

* If `npm start` fails, be sure to install nodemen as followed:
```
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```
